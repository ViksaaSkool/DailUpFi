Plays dail up sound every time you connect to the Internets! 

Feel nostalgic for the 90's?

Ready for a throw back?

Ready for a sound blast from the past?

Just turn DailUpFi ON and every time you get connected to the Internets, you'll hear it - EVEN in the background. It's that 
annoying sound that we all love. 


**One might say it's a prank app!**

It started out as a playground for learning Kotlin, as you can see it's meaningless enough that I finally pushed it trough the finish line.

TL:DR - you can use any part of the code.
